abstract: Endophytic bacteria are key members of the plant microbiome, which phylogenetic diversity has been widely described through next-generation sequencing technologies in the last decades. On the other side, a synopsis of culturable plant endophytic bacteria is still lacking in the literature. However, culturability is necessary for biotechnology innovations related to sustainable agriculture, such as biofertilizer and biostimulant agentsâ€™ development. In this review, 148 scientific papers were analyzed to establish a large data set of cultured endophytic bacteria, reported at the genus level, inhabiting different compartments of wild and farmed plants, sampled around the world from different soil types and isolated using various growth media. To the best of our knowledge, this work provides the first overview of the current repertoire of cultured plant endophytic bacteria. Results indicate the presence of a recurrent set of culturable bacterial genera regardless of factors known to influence the plant bacterial community composition and the growth media used for the bacterial isolation. Moreover, a wide variety of bacterial genera that are currently rarely isolated from the plant endosphere was identified, demonstrating that culturomics can catch previously uncultured bacteria from the plant microbiome, widening the panorama of strains exploitable to support plant holobiont health and production.
