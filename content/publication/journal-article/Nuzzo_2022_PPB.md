abstract: In vitro plant regeneration is a pivotal process in genetic engineering to obtain large numbers of transgenic, cisgenic and gene edited plants in the frame of functional gene or genetic improvement studies. However, several issues emerge as regeneration is not universally possible across the plant kingdom and many variables must be considered. In grapevine (Vitis spp.), as in other woody and fruit tree species, the regeneration process is impaired by a recalcitrance that depends on numerous factors such as genotype and explant-dependent responses. This is one of the major obstacles in developing gene editing approaches and functional genome studies in grapevine and it is therefore crucial to understand how to achieve efficient regeneration across different genotypes. Further issues that emerge in regeneration need to be addressed, such as somaclonal mutations which do not allow the regeneration of individuals identical to the original mother plant, an essential factor for commercial use of the improved grapevines obtained through the New Breeding Techniques. Over the years, the evolution of protocols to achieve plant regeneration has relied mainly on optimizing protocols for genotypes of interest whilst nowadays with new genomic data available there is an emerging opportunity to have a clearer picture of its molecular regulation. The goal of this review is to discuss the latest information available about different aspects of grapevine in vitro regeneration, to address the main factors that can impair the efficiency of the plant regeneration process and cause post-regeneration problems and to propose strategies for investigating and solving them.
