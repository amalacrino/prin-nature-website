abstract: Healthy soils are fundamental to sustainable crop production and to sustainable disease management of soilborne pathogens. Among the most common soilborne diseases, there are Fusarium wilts, caused by Fusarium oxysporum. Fusarium spp. is a trans-kingdom pathogen that includes plant pathogens, human pathogens, and saprotrophic isolates. F. oxysporum, with its wide array of formae speciales, is a wonderful model organism to explore the crosstalks between plants and their microbiota. Fusarium genomes are compartmentalized into regions responsible for essential functions (core genome) and for host specialization and pathogen virulence (lineage specific chromosomes). In F. oxysporum, different avirulence genes, coding for effectors, were identified, matching with resistance genes in the corresponding hosts. The information gained by genome sequencing could be used to design advanced diagnostic tools. Due to long persistence in the soil of F. oxysporum, the main strategy to manage Fusarium wilt is to reduce its inoculum. In addition, several control approaches are used to manage the disease. Suppressive soils are soils where disease development is minimal. Often saprophytic F. oxysporum have been isolated from suppressive soils, which have been widely exploited for their activity, based on rhizosphere competence, against soilborne pathogens. In Fusarium, horizontal chromosome transfer, and also the interaction with ectosymbiotic bacteria, could turn non-pathogenic strain into a pathogen and vice versa. F. oxysporum can also have additive or synergistic activity with plant-parasitic nematodes in the soil. Advances in the understanding of the host-pathogen-microbiota interactions contribute to the improvement of crop protection strategies to manage Fusarium wilts.
