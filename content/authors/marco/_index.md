Research interests: The research activity concerned the bioinformatics analysis of data associated with fungal and bacterial populations present in the root system of lettuce plants, both in the presence of biological control agents and the in presence of control treatments (chemical products, resistance elicitors, etc.) The technique employed was metabarcoding, which has affected the ITS region for fungi, in particular ITS2, and the V3V4 region of 16S for bacteria.
