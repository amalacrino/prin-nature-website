Research interests:  Evaluation of the interactions between 6 individual endophytic bacteria and the pathogen in vitro, Fusarium oxysporum f.sp. lactucae was co-cultured with each bacterium on PDA agar plates. To assess how the native microbiome influences the performance of microorganisms, the selection of 6 endophytic bacteria was tested in greenhouse conditions. In particular, to assess the impact of selected endophytic bacteria on biotic stresses, lettuce plants will be inoculated with Fusarium oxysporum f.sp. lactucae on roots.
