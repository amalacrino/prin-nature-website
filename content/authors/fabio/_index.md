Research interests: Evaluation of the interactions between plant and pathogens (with particular attention to fungal pathogens) through chromatographic analysis coupled to triple quadrupole mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) and absorption spectrophotometry (HPLC-DAD) of plant samples (mainly leaves and roots) to evaluate qualitatively and quantitatively the phytohormones variation in response to stress induced by biotic and abiotic factors.
